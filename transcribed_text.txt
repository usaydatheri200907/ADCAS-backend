Okay. Okay, your 5 teeth are damaged. And one of them is that your teeth are totally damaged. Meaning, you are 9 years old, and you don't have baby teeth. You don't have baby tooth, you have permanent tooth. And that is damaged. So you have to root canal it. So this is your permanent molar. And you have to get root canal treatment now. RCT. And because this is a baby, its roots were not properly developed, there was a little left. So now it will have to do more visits. And in every visit, your medicine will be added. And I will call you every week or 2-2 weeks. After every 2 weeks, I will call you for treatment. And that too for 3-4 months. And your medicine will also be changed. And after 3-4 months, we will finalize it. Final treatment. Now if the root is not complete, then this issue comes. It takes a little more time. Okay. The rest of the hygiene was not proper. Keep hygiene proper. Take good care of your teeth. And the BBs are also good. And the permanent ones too. The rest of your teeth are not so bad. So take care of them now. So that later they don't cause you problems. Okay. Normally, RCT, root canal treatment is 8000. But because we have to do a procedure for them, we have to do a procedure called Apexogenesis. So that's why their cost will be 10,000 rather than 8000. In which these multiple visits are also included for 3-4 months. Okay. Thank you so much. Khuda hafiz.
